/**
 * Builds a snapshot of editor-derived data, throttled to at most one rebuild
 * per animation frame.
 *
 * `@tiptap/vue-3` makes `editor.state` reactive with its own `customRef`.
 * That ref schedules a double `requestAnimationFrame` on every transaction,
 * with no guard against an overlapping schedule. Under a sustained input
 * burst (for example, a held Backspace key), the schedules stack up. Each
 * one fires a Vue re-render of every effect that reads `editor.state`, and
 * the page freezes.
 *
 * This composable adds the missing guard: a transaction schedules a rebuild
 * only when no rebuild is already pending. `build` always runs from a
 * `requestAnimationFrame` callback, outside any Vue effect, so it can safely
 * call `editor.isActive(...)`, `editor.can()...`, or read `editor.state` /
 * `editor.view.state` without becoming a tracked dependency.
 *
 * Each call to this composable owns its own `scheduled`/`rafId` state. Do
 * not hoist that state to module scope — multiple toolbars call this
 * composable at once, and a shared guard would make one toolbar's pending
 * frame suppress another toolbar's update.
